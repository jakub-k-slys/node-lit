# Vitejs with Lit

This projects bootstraps following frameworks:
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts: a dev server and a build command that bundles code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
* [Lit](https://lit.dev/) is a simple library for building fast, lightweight web components.
